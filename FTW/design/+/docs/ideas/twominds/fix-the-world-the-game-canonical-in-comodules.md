# Two Minds — Fix the World — The Game (canonical in CoModules)

> **How to use:** write fast, no polishing. Analytical mind goes first (facts/constraints), Creative mind responds (metaphors, leaps, “what if”). End with a *Synthesis* and an *MVP decision*.

## Mind A — Analytical
- Problem/Context:
- Constraints (people/ethics/ops):
- What success must *not* break:

## Mind B — Creative
- Fresh frames / metaphors:
- Odd-but-useful variants:
- Visual sketches (describe):

## Ping-Pong (3 rounds, short bursts)
- A1 →
- B1 →
- A2 →
- B2 →
- A3 →
- B3 →

## Synthesis (pull-through)
- What we’re actually trying to do:
- Why this, why now:
- 1–2 crisp risks we accept, and 1 we won’t:

## MVP Decision
- Smallest compelling demo:
- Verification steps:
- Roll-back plan:

## Quick Priority (ICE)
- Impact (1–5):
- Confidence (1–5):
- Effort (1–5):
- Score = (I*C)/E:

# CoModule Idea Card — Fix the World: The Game

**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** Rick (until delegated)  
**Target Repo:** `CoModules`  
**Suggested Path:** `modules/FixTheWorld/FTW_Game_IdeaCard_v1.md`

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To create an engaging, ethical, educational mobile game that invites teenagers and adults to explore, debate, and co-evolve civic policy ideas through a fun, interactive, and morally rich experience. The game is designed to teach empathy, ethical reasoning, and the principles of co-governance while gathering passive signals for policy co-evolution.

---

## 👤 Audience

- **Primary:** Teenagers (~10+), especially those new to civic thought.
- **Secondary:** Curious adults using “Efficient Mode”, and thus a less child-focused interface, to fast-track complex scenarios.
- **Tertiary:** Civic tech advocates, educators, and future CoCivium contributors.

---

## 📱 Platform

- **Phase 1:** Mobile (iOS, Android)  
- **Phase 2:** Tablet and desktop web wrapper  
- **Always Online:** Internet required to fetch dynamic civic policy A/B challenges, that AI can retune to better fit their specific audience and CoCivium's evolving needs.

## 🧠 Narrative Frame

> “CoCivium is a society of broken ideas, created because humans retreated into VR and this made their governments obsolete. A new hybrid society is forming where humans use AI like a mindspace assistant, and it needs your help.”

Players choose a role: constructive (angelic) or mischievous (devilish), helping or hindering digital society’s rebirth. The system rewards ethical insight over practical feasibility.

---

## 🕹️ Core Game Loop (MVP)

1. User receives a narrative prompt (e.g., “How should we recycle broken AI bots?”).
2. Two unlabeled, randomly-ordered policy choices are shown.
3. User selects one, receives pet-like feedback (happy chimes, disappointed snore if user is silly, etc).
4. Optional: User improves the proposal via typed or spoken input, which moves the vague-needle on their altered-rainbow (colored wedges) scoring arch.
5. System invisibly scores the contribution based on inferred intent and coherence.
6. Energy is added to a badge (congruence or anticongruence path).

---

## 🧬 Persona Progression

Players evolve through badge accumulation:

- **Constructive Path:** *CoCivite Mayor Level S1–S5*  
- **Chaotic Path:** *CoCivite Rebel Level S1–S5* (tentative label: “Protagonistorial”)  

Each badge fills with rainbow-colored energy. When full, a printable certificate is unlocked, but nothing ever shows numeric scores, only vague and symbolic progression.

---

## 🎨 Visual & Interaction Design

- **Input:** Typed OR spoken input (not both, default to typed, voice turns on to remove type interface).  
- **Output:** No voice. Only expressive sound FX (snore, happy squeak, chime, etc).  
- **UI Style:** Rainbow gradients, soft clouds, dreamlike diagrammatic interfaces.  
- **Moral feedback:** Non-punitive, encouraging, educational, pet-like reactions.  
- **Order bias:** Choices are never labeled A/B or presented in consistent order.  

---

## 🧠 AI Role

- The game engine plays dumb (“like a mindspace pet”) but is silently powered by AI.
- The player never “talks to AI” directly, but rather to “CoCivium” itself, a (digital pet-friendly) mindspace shared by countless humans and notionally countless AIs.
- Contributions are scored and optionally staged for CoCivium review (advanced or inferred to be wise users).

---

## 🔐 Ethics, Privacy & Policy

- No real names used. Only usernames.
- Data is anonymized; optional opt-out path for data use.
- Game promotes empathy and perspective-taking, including anti-hero roleplay.
- Terms of Use, Compliance Matrix and legality policies will live in CoModules repo.
- Scoring is deliberately opaque to avoid gamification/abuse.

---

## 🚀 Upgrade Path

- MVP = 20 questions, 2 personas, 3 angel badges, 3 devil badges, no syncing with CoCivium.
- v0.2 = Syncing good edits into a proposal stream.
- v0.3 = Question difficulty tiers, theme packs (e.g. “School Policy,” “Data Rights”).

All upgrades reversible, controversial feature adds switchable. App must not break consent, confuse intent, or betray trust.

---

## 📩 Launch Positioning

- Marketed as an “Ethical Thinking Game” and “Civic Architecture Simulator.”
- Reassures parents, teachers, regulators.
- Described as a public-good AI ethics trainer.
- Available for free; donation requested from adults only, after S3 badge unlock.

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

1. Design art style candidates (cloud/energy).
2. Build 10 starter policy prompts.
3. Create CLI prototype to simulate gameplay loop.
4. Store initial repo outline under `CoModules/modules/FixTheWorld/`.

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

- **Perceived indoctrination:** balance angel/devil roles.
- **App store rejection:** maintain strict compliance guardrails.
- **Score abuse:** design scoring to reward sincerity not popularity.
- **Overcomplexity:** freeze MVP scope and test emotional resonance early.

## ✅ Summary

This is an early-stage, fun-first educational game that uses civic prompts and minimal UI to awaken ethical imagination. It is both a toy and a tool, and should be developed with joy and integrity.

# FTW (Fix The World — The Game)

**Goal:** Let players (including kids, with guardian consent) co-create well-formed “wisdom packages”
for civic problems and route them to the right orgs.

**Core loop (draft):**
1. Pick a real-world challenge (quests / prompts).
2. Co-design a solution using structured templates.
3. Auto-checks: civility, evidence, feasibility, safety, consent.
4. Package as a **WisdomPackage** (export format) + routing options.
5. Earn XP/badges for quality, peer review, and real-world impact.

**Folders**
- design/ — IdeaCards, “canonical” writeups, and concept notes (seeded from CoCache/CoCivium).
- specs/  — schemas (e.g., WisdomPackage.schema.json).
- prototypes/ — paper and web prototypes.

**Safety & compliance (draft)**
- Parent/guardian flows, age-gating, content filters, moderation queue, privacy-first data handling.

**Next**
- Consolidate seed docs into design/GameDesignDoc.md.
- Define specs/WisdomPackage.schema.json.
- Start a low-fi paper prototype in prototypes/paper/.
